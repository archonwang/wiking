# Redmine WikiNG Plugin

The Wiki: Next Generation (WikiNG) plugin for [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) is aimed to extend Redmine Wiki syntax by making it more developer-ready, more emotional and social.

Additionally, this plugin adds user mentions (with list of mentions, email notifications and autocompletion) and custom editable Wiki macros (that can be specified through UI by administrators).

For more information check [the project page](http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/project/redmine/wiking) of the plugin.
